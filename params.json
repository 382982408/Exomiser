{"name":"Exomiser","tagline":"A Tool to Annotate and Prioritise Exome Variants","body":"### Welcome to The Exomiser.\r\n\r\nExomiser is an application that prioritizes genes and variants in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) projects for novel disease-gene discovery or differential diagnostics of Mendelian disease. Exomiser comprises a suite of algorithms for prioritizing exome sequences using random-walk analysis of protein interaction networks, clinical relevance, and cross-species phenotype comparisons, as well as a wide range of other computational filters for variant frequency, predicted pathogenicity, and pedigree analysis. In this protocol, we provide a detailed explanation of how to install Exomiser and use it to prioritize exome sequences in a number of scenarios. Exomiser requires ~3 GB of RAM and roughly 15-90 seconds of compute time to analyze a variant (VCF) file. Exomiser is freely available for academic use from http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/exomiser/.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects.
