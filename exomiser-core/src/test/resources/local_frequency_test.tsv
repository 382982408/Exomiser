##Test file for local frequency data.
##Chromosome names: 1-22, X, Y, M
##Positions should be 1-based.
##REF/ALT deletions should have a '.' character in their place.
##Frequency column should be a percentage value i.e. range 0.0 - 100.0
##Multiple alternative alleles should be split so that each occurs on its own line.
